**ARTICLE LINK:** [WeAreDevelopers - What is Software engineering?](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/en/magazine/289/what-is-software-engineering)

I read this article which describe in detail what software engineering is, and all the fundamental roles of a software engineer. It frames software engineering as a practice that goes beyond just coding but rather the application of scientific principles to solve problems. It detailes the different categories of software engineering as **Operational software engineering**, **Transitional software engineering** and **Software engineering maintenance**.

The article also differenciates between a software engineer and a software developer. It acknowledges the differences between a software engineer and software developer as well, stating how engineer takes into account the entire scope of the project, involves systems thinking and also the non-functional requirements of a project.
